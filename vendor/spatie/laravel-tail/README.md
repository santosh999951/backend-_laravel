This package offers an Artisan command to tail the application log. It supports daily and single logs on your local machine.

Spatie is a webdesign agency in Antwerp, Belgium. You'll find an overview of all our open source projects [on our website](https://spatie.be/opensource).

## Install

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-tail
```

You're done. Run `php artisan tail` to tail your log.

## Usage

To tail the log you can use this command:

```bash
php artisan tail
```

You can start the output with displaying the last lines in the log by using the `lines`-option.

```bash
php artisan tail --lines=50
```

To filter out stack traces from the output, you can use the `hide-stack-traces`-option.

```bash
php artisan tail --hide-stack-traces
```

It's also possible to fully clear the output buffer after each log item.
This can be useful if you're only interested in the last log entry when debugging.

```bash
php artisan tail --clear
```

This package was created because [the awesome tail command present in Laravel 4](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/4.2/src/Illuminate/Foundation/Console/TailCommand.php) was dropped in Laravel 5. The tail command from this package is equivalent to Laravel's old one minus the remote tailing features.
